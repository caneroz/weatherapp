# WeatherApp
An app where weather is shown for user's location using darksky api.

For network part I used OkHttp and Retrofit which I am familiar with. For service calls I used coroutines.

MVVM architecture is used with Kotlin.

Material design widgets are used.

Swipe to refresh is used for refreshing weather info.

Prebuilt apk is in WeatherApp\apk folder.

Weather Icons are from SkyconsLibrary: https://github.com/torryharris/Skycons

SDK: 30
